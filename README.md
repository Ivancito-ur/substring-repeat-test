# Test Solving Programming Problems API

Having a string of random characters and random length, create a method that identifies how many substrings of 4 characters appear more than once along the main string. The methodâ€™s only argument should be the main string.

It should return the substrings that repeat and how many times they appear in the text in a data structure.

Important:
- Substrings of 4 characters
- How many times they appear in the text
- Random characters and random length
## Install Python
Verify that you have Python on your operating system with:

Windows
```bash
py --version
```

Mac o Linux
```bash
python --version
```


You need install Python 3.9^

## Clone and Run Project

Clone the project from repository in any folder:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/ivanuribe39/substring-repeat-test.git
```

After you have cloned the project. Enter the project and run the following command to run the script.


Windows (CMD)
```bash
py string_random.py 
```

Linux or Mac (bash or zsh)
```bash
python string_random.py 
```

In the terminal it will show the following text:
```bash
$ py string_random.py 
Insert a string of characters with the range you want. To exit execution CTRL+BREAK
String: 
```



## Example Test

For testing we use the following string:

```bash
$ py string_random.py 
Insert a string of characters with the range you want. To exit execution CTRL+BREAK
String: acceaceaceeabcbabcdabcdebcde
```


The script will return the responses in the following order:


```bash
ceac 2
eace 2
abcd 2
bcde 2
```


The first value corresponds to the repeated substring and the second value the times it is repeated.
